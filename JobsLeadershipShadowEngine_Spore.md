spore.description: >
  A spore containing the 22D Leadership Engine, 4 Dark-Side Modulators,
  coupling relations, ethical dampers, shadow-attractor math, and
  a 3D force-diagram specification for downstream agents.

spore.outputs:
  - jobs_leadership_engine.ttl
  - jobs_shadow_engine.ttl
  - jobs_shadow_math.md
  - jobs_shadow_coupling_spec.json
  - jobs_shadow_coupling.png

spore.instructions:
  - "Preserve TTL syntax as valid OWL/RDF/Turtle."
  - "Math should render in LaTeX/MathJax-friendly Markdown."
  - "Diagram agents may render jobs_shadow_coupling_spec.json as a 3D force layout."

spore.notes:
  - "Designed for ingestion by Cursor, Claude, Ghostbusters, or Fort agents."
  - "Ethical dampers module models how organizations buffer high-variance leaders."
